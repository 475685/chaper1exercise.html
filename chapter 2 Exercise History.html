    <h1>History</h1>
    
    <p>The film starts with invasions of India by the Mughal Empire. Guru Tegh Bahadur (the ninth Guru of Sikhdom) sacrificed his life for the rights and freedom of religion of the Kashmiri pandits. Following this, Guru Gobind Singh founded the Khalsa to counter the invading forces with martyrdom as the fundamental principle of defence. The film depicts the Battle of Anandpur (1700) in which the Mughal General Painde Khan was slain by Guru Gobind Singh. The film also depicts the Battle of Chamkaur which took place in December, 1704 CE in which forty two Sikhs (under Guru Gobind Singh) fought bravely against ten lakh Mughal forces under the command of Wazir Khan. In the Battle of Chamkaur, both the elder sons of Guru Gobind Singh Sahibzada Ajit Singh and Sahibzada Jujhar Singh were martyred in combat. The Mughals were composed of large numbers, yet ultimately failed to capture Guru Gobind Singh, culminating in their defeat. The younger sons of Guru Gobind Singh, Sahibzada Zorawar Singh and Sahibzada Fateh Singh, were taken to Wazir Khan's palace and were executed by the Mughal ruler of Sirhind. Wazir Khan gave orders that the masons immure both sons into a section of the city's wall.
